# ðŸ”§ Fixed: Duplicate Edit/Preview Buttons

## Issue

The Edit/Preview toggle buttons were appearing **twice** on the Job Assistant page.

## Root Cause

The `MarkdownEditor` component had its own built-in Edit/Preview toggle (from the original implementation), and I added a second set of toggle buttons at the wizard level for the new preview feature.

This caused both sets to render, creating duplicate buttons.

## Solution

**Removed** the internal Edit/Preview toggle from `markdown-editor.tsx` and kept only the wizard-level toggle in `job-assistant-wizard.tsx`.

### Changes Made:

**File: `components/admin/job-assistant/markdown-editor.tsx`**

**Before:**

- Had `useState` for mode (edit/preview)
- Rendered two toggle buttons
- MDEditor switched between edit and preview modes
- Dynamic helper text based on mode

**After:**

- Removed `useState` and mode toggle buttons
- Always renders in `edit` mode
- Simplified to just show the markdown editor
- Static helper text
- Mode control now handled by parent (wizard)

## Result

âœ… Only **one** set of Edit/Preview buttons now appears  
âœ… Buttons are at the wizard level, controlling both the editor and new preview component  
âœ… Cleaner UI with no duplication  
âœ… Better separation of concerns (wizard controls the view, editor just edits)

## How It Works Now

**Wizard Level** (`job-assistant-wizard.tsx`):

- Has Edit/Preview toggle buttons
- Controls `viewMode` state
- When "Edit" â†’ shows `<MarkdownEditor />`
- When "Preview" â†’ shows `<ResumePreview />`

**Editor Component** (`markdown-editor.tsx`):

- Pure editing component
- No mode toggle
- Always shows toolbar
- Focused on markdown editing only

**Preview Component** (`resume-preview.tsx`):

- Pure display component
- Shows formatted, professional resume
- No editing capabilities
