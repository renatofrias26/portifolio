# 📋 Job Assistant - URL Compatibility Guide

## ✅ Sites That Work Well

These job boards typically work great with URL scraping:

### **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**

- ✅ **Greenhouse** - `boards.greenhouse.io/*`
- ✅ **Lever** - `jobs.lever.co/*`
- ✅ **Workday** - `*.myworkdayjobs.com/*`
- ✅ **Ashby** - `jobs.ashbyhq.com/*`
- ✅ **BambooHR** - `*.bamboohr.com/careers/*`
- ✅ **JazzHR** - `*.applytojob.com/*`

### **Job Boards**

- ✅ **Indeed** - `indeed.com/viewjob/*` (public postings)
- ⚠️ **Glassdoor** - Sometimes works, sometimes blocked
- ⚠️ **ZipRecruiter** - May require JavaScript

### **Company Career Pages**

- ✅ Most custom career pages using standard ATS
- ✅ Simple HTML-based job postings
- ⚠️ Pages requiring JavaScript to load content

---

## ❌ Sites That Usually Don't Work

These sites typically block automated scraping:

### **Professional Networks**

- ❌ **LinkedIn Jobs** - Requires login, blocks bots
  - Even with valid URL, returns 403 or redirect to login
  - **Solution:** Copy/paste the job description

### **Protected Platforms**

- ❌ Sites behind **Cloudflare** bot protection
- ❌ Sites requiring **authentication/login**
- ❌ Sites with **heavy JavaScript** (React/Vue SPAs)
- ❌ Sites with **reCAPTCHA** or similar challenges

### **Enterprise Platforms**

- ❌ **Internal job boards** (company intranets)
- ❌ **Private career portals** (login required)
- ❌ **Recruiting platforms** with paywall

## 🎯 How to Handle Blocked URLs

When you see this error:

```
Failed to fetch job posting from URL.
The website may be blocking automated access.
Please paste the job description manually instead.
```

### **Quick Fix (Takes 30 seconds):**

1. **Open the URL in your browser**

   - The job posting displays normally for you

2. **Select all the text**

   - Windows: `Ctrl + A`
   - Mac: `Cmd + A`

3. **Copy everything**

   - Windows: `Ctrl + C`
   - Mac: `Cmd + C`

4. **Paste in "Job Description" field**

   - Just paste the entire thing - our AI will parse it

5. **Click Generate**
   - Works 100% of the time!
   - Even better than URL scraping (you control what's included)

## 💡 Why Some URLs Don't Work

### **Bot Protection**

Many sites use anti-bot services like:

- Cloudflare Bot Management
- PerimeterX
- Akamai Bot Manager
- reCAPTCHA

These detect automated requests and block them.

### **Authentication Required**

Sites like LinkedIn require you to be logged in:

- No public API
- Cookie-based authentication
- Can't scrape without session

### **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**

Some sites load content dynamically:

- Initial HTML is empty
- Content loads via React/Vue/Angular
- Our scraper only sees the shell

### **Rate Limiting**

Some sites limit requests:

- Too many requests = blocked
- IP-based throttling
- May work sometimes, fail others

## 🔍 Testing URL Compatibility

### **Quick Test:**

1. Open the URL in an incognito/private window
2. If you can see the full job description without logging in → Probably works
3. If you need to log in → Won't work, use manual paste

### **Check for Indicators:**

- ✅ `greenhouse.io` in URL → Should work
- ✅ `lever.co` in URL → Should work
- ✅ `workday` in URL → Should work
- ❌ `linkedin.com/jobs` → Won't work
- ⚠️ Long URL with tokens/session IDs → May not work

## 🎨 Best Practices

### **Option 1: Try URL First (Recommended)**

```
1. Paste job URL
2. Click Generate
3. If it works → Great!
4. If it fails → See error, follow instructions to paste manually
```

**Pros:**

- Fast if it works
- Automatic extraction
- Less manual work

**Cons:**

- May fail for some sites
- Requires fallback

---

### **Option 2: Always Use Manual Paste (100% Reliable)**

```
1. Open job posting in browser
2. Copy entire description
3. Paste in "Job Description" field
4. Click Generate
```

**Pros:**

- Works 100% of the time
- You control what gets included
- No URL errors

**Cons:**

- Requires manual copy/paste
- Slightly slower

---

### **Option 3: Provide Both (Belt & Suspenders)**

```
1. Paste URL in URL field
2. Also paste description in Job Description field
3. If URL works → Uses scraped data
4. If URL fails → Falls back to manual description automatically
```

**Pros:**

- Best of both worlds
- Automatic fallback
- Maximum reliability

**Cons:**

- More work upfront
- Redundant if URL works

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **"Request timed out after 15 seconds"**

- The website is very slow
- Try again, or use manual paste
- Not a permanent block

### **"HTTP 403: Forbidden"**

- Website is actively blocking bots
- Use manual paste method
- Won't work no matter how many times you try

### **"Could not extract enough content"**

- Page loaded but content is JavaScript-based
- Use manual paste method
- Our scraper can't run JavaScript

### **"Invalid URL format"**

- Check that URL starts with `https://` or `http://`
- Make sure URL is complete
- Try copying URL again from browser

## 🎓 Understanding the Technology

### **What We Do:**

1. Send HTTP request to job posting URL
2. Download HTML content
3. Parse with Cheerio (jQuery-like)
4. Extract job title, company, description
5. Use AI as fallback if needed

### **What We Can't Do:**

- Run JavaScript
- Handle authentication
- Bypass bot protection
- Solve CAPTCHAs
- Maintain sessions/cookies

### **Why Manual Paste Works:**

- You (human) load the page
- You can log in if needed
- You can solve CAPTCHAs
- You copy the rendered content
- We get the full text without restrictions

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Most Users:**

- Try URL first

- Copy/paste job description manually
- Takes 30 seconds, works every time

**For Power Users:**

- If you know the site blocks bots (e.g., LinkedIn)
- Skip URL field
- Go straight to manual paste
- Saves time by not attempting scrape

**For Maximum Reliability:**

- Provide both URL and manual description
- System tries URL first
- Falls back automatically if URL fails
- You never see an error

## 📝 Summary

| Method      | Speed     | Reliability | Effort    |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| URL Only    | ⚡ Fast   | ⚠️ 60-70%   | 🟢 Low    |
| Manual Only | 🐌 Slower | ✅ 100%     | 🟡 Medium |
| Both        | ⚡ Fast   | ✅ 100%     | 🟠 Higher |

**Bottom Line:**  
URL scraping is a nice-to-have convenience feature, but manual paste is the reliable fallback. Don't worry if URLs don't work - it's expected for many sites, and the manual method is quick and easy!

---

**Pro Tip:** Some users prefer manual paste anyway because they can:

- Remove irrelevant sections (company perks, legal disclaimers)
- Add context or notes
- Combine multiple sources
- Include info from emails/messages

The AI works great with any text you provide! 🎉
