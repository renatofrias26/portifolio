# Auto-Rotating Highlight Colors Feature

## ✅ Upgraded Feature: Smart Color Distribution

The tagline highlight feature now automatically distributes colors based on the order of highlights, making it theme-independent and easier to use!

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### Simple Syntax
Users only need to use **one marker**: `##text##`

The system automatically assigns colors in rotation:
- 1st highlight → Purple
- 2nd highlight → Blue  
- 3rd highlight → Teal
- 4th highlight → Purple (cycles back)
- And so on...

---

## 📝 Example Usage

### Input:
```
From ##Mechatronics Engineering## to ##Software Development##, now specializing in ##AI Solutions##
```

### Output:
```
From [Mechatronics Engineering] to [Software Development], now specializing in [AI Solutions]
      ↑ purple                      ↑ blue                                  ↑ teal
```

## 💡 Benefits

### 1. **Simpler for Users**
- No need to remember different markers (`**`, `##`, `~~`)
- Just wrap any text you want highlighted in `##text##`
- System handles the rest automatically

### 2. **Theme-Independent**
- Not tied to specific color assignments
- Future theme support: just change the color array
- Easy to add more colors or swap color schemes

### 3. **Consistent Design**
- Colors are distributed evenly
- Professional appearance without user effort
- No risk of using the same color twice in a row

### 4. **Predictable Behavior**
- Order-based: first highlight always purple, second always blue, etc.
- Users can preview exactly how it will look
- Deterministic output

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Hero Section (`components/sections/hero-section.tsx`)

```typescript
const parseTagline = (text: string) => {
  const colors = ["purple", "blue", "teal"] as const;
  let highlightCount = 0;
  
  // Find all ##text## markers
  const regex = /(\#\#([^#]+)\#\#)/g;
  
  // For each match:
  // - Assign color index: highlightCount % colors.length
  // - Increment counter
  // - Apply corresponding color class
}
```

### Color Cycling Logic
```
highlight #0: 0 % 3 = 0 → purple
highlight #1: 1 % 3 = 1 → blue
highlight #2: 2 % 3 = 2 → teal
highlight #3: 3 % 3 = 0 → purple (cycle)
...
```

## 🎨 UI Guide in Profile Settings

The profile settings page shows:

```
Add highlights with ##text## - colors auto-rotate!

##highlight## → ⚫🔵🔷...
```

With visual color dots showing the rotation pattern.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

This architecture makes it easy to:

1. **Add More Colors**
   ```typescript
   const colors = ["purple", "blue", "teal", "pink", "orange"] as const;
   ```

2. **Theme-Specific Colors**
   ```typescript
   const colors = theme === "dark" 
     ? ["purple-400", "blue-400", "teal-400"]
     : ["purple-600", "blue-600", "teal-600"];
   ```

3. **User-Selected Color Schemes**
   ```typescript
   const colors = userTheme.highlightColors || defaultColors;
   ```

4. **Smart Distribution**
   - Could analyze text length
   - Balance color distribution
   - Avoid similar colors adjacent

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (3 Different Markers)
```
From **Mechatronics Engineering** to ##Software Development##, now ~~AI Solutions~~
      ↑ user must remember **=purple, ##=blue, ~~=teal
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Three different markers to remember
- ❌ User must manually assign colors
- ❌ Tied to specific color meanings
- ❌ Can't easily change theme

### After (Single Marker)
```
From ##Mechatronics Engineering## to ##Software Development##, now ##AI Solutions##
      ↑ simple, consistent, auto-colored
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One marker to remember
- ✅ Automatic color distribution
- ✅ Theme-independent
- ✅ Easy to customize
