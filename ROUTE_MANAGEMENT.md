# Route Management & Authentication Flow

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive route management to prevent logged-in users from accessing authentication pages and provide easy dashboard access.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Protected Authentication Routes

#### Login Page (`/app/admin/login/page.tsx`)

- Added `useSession` hook to check authentication status
- Redirects authenticated users to `/admin/dashboard`
- Shows loading spinner while checking auth status
- Prevents rendering login form if already authenticated

#### Register Page (`/app/admin/register/page.tsx`)

- Added `useSession` hook to check authentication status
- Redirects authenticated users to `/admin/dashboard`
- Shows loading spinner while checking auth status
- Prevents rendering registration form if already authenticated
- Includes terms & privacy policy acceptance checkbox

### 2. Global Session Provider

#### Client Session Provider (`/components/client-session-provider.tsx`)

- Wraps the app with NextAuth's `SessionProvider`
- Enables `useSession` hook throughout the application
- Added to root layout for global access

#### Root Layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)

- Wrapped children with `ClientSessionProvider`
- Provides session context to all pages
- Maintains server component benefits while enabling client-side auth

### 3. Navigation Header

#### Landing Header Component (`/components/landing-header.tsx`)

- Sticky header with logo and navigation
- Shows different UI based on authentication status:
  - **Unauthenticated**: Login + Sign Up buttons
  - **Authenticated**: Dashboard button with icon
  - **Loading**: Skeleton placeholders
- Prevents hydration mismatch with `mounted` state
- Includes "Browse Portfolios" link for all users
- Responsive design (icon-only on mobile, text on desktop)

#### Integration

- Added to landing page (`/app/page.tsx`)
- Added to profiles page (`/app/profiles/page.tsx`)
- Removed redundant "Back to Home" link from profiles page

## User Flow

### New User (Unauthenticated)

1. Visits landing page → sees Login + Sign Up in header
2. Clicks "Sign Up" → fills registration form
3. Must accept terms & privacy policy to register
4. After successful registration → auto-logged in and redirected to dashboard
5. Trying to access `/admin/login` or `/admin/register` → redirected to dashboard

### Returning User (Authenticated)

1. Visits any page → sees "Dashboard" button in header
2. Clicks "Dashboard" → goes directly to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Trying to access `/admin/login` or `/admin/register` → redirected to dashboard
4. Can browse profiles and view portfolios while logged in

### Recruiter/Visitor

1. Can browse profiles and portfolios without logging in
2. Header shows Login + Sign Up options
3. Can create account when ready

## Security Features

- Client-side route protection prevents unnecessary page renders
- Server-side authentication still validates all API requests
- Session-based access control
- Terms & privacy policy acceptance required on registration

## Performance Optimizations

- Hydration-safe header component
- Loading states prevent layout shift
- Skeleton placeholders during auth check
- Static generation where possible (landing page, profiles)
