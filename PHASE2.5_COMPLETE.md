## 🔄 Publishing Logic

```typescript
When you publish Version 2:
1. Unpublish Version 1 (if was published)
2. Set Version 2 as published
3. Update database
4. Refresh the list
5. Show success state
```

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Login**: http://localhost:3000/admin/login

3. **Upload a resume**:

   - Go to "Upload Resume" tab
   - Drop a PDF
   - Wait for AI processing
   - ✨ Auto-switches to Versions tab

4. **See your version**:

   - Version 1 appears with "Draft" badge
   - Click "View PDF" to verify upload

5. **Publish it**:

   - Click "Publish" button
   - Badge changes to "Published" (green)
   - Publish button disappears

6. **Upload another**:

   - Switch back to "Upload Resume"
   - Upload different PDF
   - Version 2 appears

7. **Publish Version 2**:
