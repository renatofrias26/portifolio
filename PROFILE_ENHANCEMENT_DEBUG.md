# Profile Enhancement Registration Fix

## Issue

After creating an account with AI-generated profile enhancements, the portfolio settings page was not populated with the tagline, professional title, and current focus.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Field Name Mismatch

**Problem:** The register API was saving `professionalTitle` but the profile page was looking for `title`.

**Before:**

```typescript
// Register API saved:
{
  professionalTitle: profileEnhancements.professionalTitle,
  tagline: profileEnhancements.selectedTagline,
  ...
}

// Profile page expected:
profileData.title  // ❌ Not found!
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Register API now saves:
{
  title: profileEnhancements.professionalTitle,  // ✅ Matches!
  tagline: profileEnhancements.selectedTagline,
  ...
}
```

### 2. SessionStorage Structure Mismatch

**Problem:** The `handlePublish` function in guest uploader was storing `tagline` instead of `selectedTagline`.

**Before:**

```typescript
// Guest uploader stored:
{
  tagline: selectedTagline,  // ❌ Wrong field name
  professionalTitle: ...
}

// Register API expected:
profileEnhancements.selectedTagline  // ❌ Not found!
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Guest uploader now stores:
{
  selectedTagline: selectedTagline,  // ✅ Matches!
  professionalTitle: ...
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `/components/guest-resume-uploader.tsx`

- **Line 213:** Changed `tagline: selectedTagline` → `selectedTagline: selectedTagline`
- Ensures sessionStorage structure matches what register API expects

### 2. `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`

- **Line 61:** Changed `professionalTitle:` → `title:`
- Ensures database field names match what profile page expects
- **Line 68-71:** Added console logging for debugging:
  ```typescript
  console.log("Registering user with profile enhancements:", {
    hasEnhancements: !!profileEnhancements,
    profileData: profileData,
  });
  ```

### 3. `/app/admin/register/page.tsx`

- **Line 78-81:** Added console logging to verify sessionStorage data:
  ```typescript
  console.log("Profile enhancements from sessionStorage:", {
    raw: guestProfileEnhancements,
    parsed: profileEnhancements,
  });
  ```

## Data Flow

### Complete Flow:

1. **Guest Upload** → Parse resume with AI
2. **Enhancement** → Generate 5 taglines, professional title, focus areas
3. **User Selects** → Choose favorite tagline
4. **handlePublish** → Store in sessionStorage as:

   ```json
   {
     "selectedTagline": "Build. Ship. Repeat.",
     "professionalTitle": "Full-Stack Developer",
     "currentFocus": ["Next.js", "AI Integration", "Web Performance"],
     "bio": "..."
   }
   ```

5. **Registration** → Read from sessionStorage, send to API
6. **Register API** → Save to database as:

   ```json
   {
     "tagline": "Build. Ship. Repeat.",
     "title": "Full-Stack Developer",
     "currentFocus": ["Next.js", "AI Integration", "Web Performance"],
     "bio": "..."
   }
   ```

7. **Profile Page** → Load from `user.profile_data`:
   - `profileData.tagline` → ✅ Found!
   - `profileData.title` → ✅ Found!
   - `profileData.currentFocus` → ✅ Found!
   - `profileData.bio` → ✅ Found!

## Database Schema

The `users.profile_data` JSONB column should contain:

```json
{
  "title": "Professional Title (e.g., Full-Stack Developer)",
  "tagline": "Hero section tagline (e.g., Build. Ship. Repeat.)",
  "currentFocus": ["Focus 1", "Focus 2", "Focus 3"],
  "bio": "Professional bio/summary",
  "contactInfo": { ... },
  "socialLinks": { ... }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

1. ✅ Upload resume on landing page
2. ✅ Wait for AI to generate taglines
3. ✅ Select a tagline (different from first one)
4. ✅ Click "Publish Your Portfolio"
5. ✅ Complete registration
6. ✅ Open browser console and verify logs:
   - Should see: "Profile enhancements from sessionStorage"
   - Should see: "Registering user with profile enhancements"
   - Both should show the selected tagline and professional title
7. ✅ Navigate to Admin → Profile Settings
8. ✅ Verify fields are populated:
   - Professional Title field has AI-generated title
   - Tagline field has selected tagline
   - Current Focus chips show AI-generated focus areas

## Debugging

If profile settings are still not populated:

1. **Check Browser Console:**

   - Look for "Profile enhancements from sessionStorage" log
   - Verify `parsed` object has correct structure

2. **Check Server Logs:**

   - Look for "Registering user with profile enhancements" log
   - Verify `profileData` string contains expected values

3. **Check Database:**

   ```sql
   SELECT username, profile_data FROM users WHERE username = 'your-username';
   ```

   - Should show JSONB with `title`, `tagline`, `currentFocus`, `bio`

4. **Check Profile API Response:**
   - Open Network tab in browser
   - Navigate to Profile Settings
   - Check `/api/admin/profile` response
   - Verify `user.profileData` contains expected fields
