# 🚀 Phase 2: PDF Upload & AI Processing

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. **File Storage Integration**

- ✅ Vercel Blob SDK installed
- ✅ Upload API endpoint created
- ✅ PDF file validation (type & size)

### 2. **PDF Processing**

- ✅ PDF text extraction (pdf-parse)
- ✅ OpenAI integration for AI parsing
- ✅ Structured data extraction
- ✅ Resume format conversion

### 3. **Upload UI**

- ✅ Drag & drop interface
- ✅ File selection
- ✅ Upload progress indicator
- ✅ Success/error feedback
- ✅ Beautiful animations

### 4. **Admin Dashboard Updates**

- ✅ Tab-based navigation
- ✅ Upload Resume tab with full functionality
- ✅ Manage Versions tab (placeholder)
- ✅ Improved navigation with Home link

## 📦 New Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@vercel/blob": "^2.0.0",
    "openai": "^6.3.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^17.2.3"
  }
}
```

Note: `pdf-parse` is already bundled with dependencies

## 🗂️ New Files Created

```
app/
└── api/
    └── admin/
        └── upload-resume/
            └── route.ts          ← PDF upload & AI parsing API

components/
└── admin/
    └── resume-uploader.tsx       ← Upload UI component

lib/
└── resume-parser.ts              ← AI resume parsing logic
```

## ⚙️ Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Vercel Blob Storage

1. Go to: [vercel.com/dashboard/stores](https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores)
2. Click "Create" on **Blob** (under Vercel First-Party)
3. Name it (e.g., "portfolio-files")
4. Copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Vercel Blob Storage
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="vercel_blob_rw_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Your complete `.env.local` should now have:

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxx"

# Neon Database
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://xxxxx"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="xxxxx"

# Vercel Blob
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="vercel_blob_rw_xxxxx"
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User uploads PDF** → Drag & drop or click to browse
2. **File validation** → Check type (PDF only) and size (max 10MB)
3. **Upload to Blob** → Store PDF in Vercel Blob Storage
4. **Extract text** → Use pdf-parse to get text from PDF
5. **AI parsing** → Send to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured prompt
6. **Store data** → Save parsed JSON + PDF URL to Neon database
7. **Show result** → Display success message with version info

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start dev server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Login to admin:

   - http://localhost:3000/admin/login
   - Email: `admin@portfolio.com`
   - Password: `changeme123`

3. Go to "Upload Resume" tab

4. Upload a PDF resume

5. Watch the magic! ✨
   - File uploads to Blob
   - AI extracts and structures data
   - Data saves to database

## 📝 What's Next (Phase 2.5)

- [ ] Display list of uploaded resume versions
- [ ] Preview parsed data before publishing
- [ ] Edit functionality for manual corrections
- [ ] Publish button to make a version live
- [ ] Replace static `resume.ts` with dynamic data

## 🔍 API Response Format

Successful upload returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Resume uploaded and parsed successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "version": 1,
    "pdfUrl": "https://blob.vercel-storage.com/...",
    "parsedData": {
      "personal": {...},
      "experience": [...],
      "education": [...],
      "skills": {...},
      "projects": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **OpenAI API Key Required**: AI parsing won't work without it
- **Blob Storage Required**: PDF uploads need Blob storage configured
- **Max File Size**: 10MB limit for PDF files
- **Processing Time**: AI parsing can take 10-30 seconds
- **Draft Mode**: Uploaded resumes are saved as drafts (not published yet)

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Complete - PDF Upload & AI Parsing Working!

**Next**: Set up Blob storage and test the upload feature! 🎉
