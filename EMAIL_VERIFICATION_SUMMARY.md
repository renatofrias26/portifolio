## Security Features

✅ Cryptographically secure tokens (32 bytes, crypto.randomBytes)  
✅ 24-hour token expiration  
✅ One-time use tokens (deleted after verification)  
✅ Database indexes for performance  
✅ Session integration with NextAuth  
✅ Graceful email service degradation in development

## Build Status

```bash
pnpm build
```

✅ **Result**: Build successful  
⚠️ **Warnings**: Minor ESLint warnings (unused vars) - non-blocking  
✅ **TypeScript**: All type errors resolved  
✅ **Production Ready**: Yes

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration successful
- [x] Existing users auto-verified
- [x] Verification email sends on registration
- [x] Email contains correct link with token
- [x] Verification page auto-verifies token
- [x] Token expiration works (24 hours)
- [x] Token deleted after verification

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)

- [ ] Fix ESLint warnings (remove unused imports)
- [ ] Test email deliverability in production
- [ ] Set up Resend domain verification

### High Priority

- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse of send verification endpoint
- [ ] **Token Cleanup Job** - Delete expired tokens daily

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Real-time session updates (WebSocket/polling)
- [ ] Email preferences center
- [ ] Hash verification tokens before storage

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run migration
npx tsx scripts/migrate-add-email-verification.ts

# Verify existing users
npx tsx scripts/verify-existing-users.ts

# View unverified users
npx tsx -e "import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres'; import { config } from 'dotenv'; config({ path: '.env.local' }); (async () => { const result = await sql\`SELECT id, email, email_verified FROM users WHERE email_verified = false\`; console.table(result.rows); })();"

# Build and verify
pnpm build
```
