## 🚀 Recommended Enhancements

### 1. **Job Fit Analysis** (HIGH PRIORITY - Landing Page Promise)

**What to Build:**
A quick AI-powered analysis that shows how well the candidate's resume matches the job requirements.

**Features:**

- **Match Score** (0-100%) based on:
  - Skills alignment
  - Experience level match
  - Industry/domain fit
  - Education requirements
  - Years of experience
- **Visual Breakdown:**

  ```
  Overall Match: 85% 🟢

  Skills Match:        ████████░░ 80%
  Experience Level:    ██████████ 95%
  Education:           ████████░░ 85%
  Industry Fit:        ███████░░░ 75%
  ```

- **Key Insights:**
  - ✅ Strong matches (e.g., "Your Python & React experience aligns perfectly")
  - ⚠️ Gaps (e.g., "Job requires AWS certification - consider highlighting cloud projects")
  - 💡 Recommendations (e.g., "Emphasize your leadership experience in your resume")

**Implementation:**

1. New API endpoint: `/api/job-assistant/analyze-fit`
2. New function in `lib/job-assistant.ts`: `analyzeJobFit()`
3. Display analysis BEFORE user clicks "Generate Documents"
4. Uses GPT-4o-mini (faster, cheaper) with structured output
5. Token cost: 2-3 credits (low cost for quick analysis)

**UI Location:**

- Show analysis panel after job info is entered
- Before the "Generate" step
- Help users decide if they should apply

#### B. **Smart Suggestions**

- "This job emphasizes [X skill] - make sure to highlight your [Y project]"
