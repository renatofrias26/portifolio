# Preview Enhancements - Complete Website Preview

## Overview

Enhanced the resume preview modal to display a 1-to-1 replica of the actual website, including navigation, hero section, and all content sections.

## Changes Made

### 1. HeroSection Component Refactoring

**File**: `components/sections/hero-section.tsx`

Made the HeroSection component reusable by accepting personal information as props:

```typescript
interface PersonalInfo {
  name: string;
  title: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  location: string;
}

interface HeroSectionProps {
  personal?: PersonalInfo;
  showScrollButton?: boolean;
}
```

**Key Features**:

- Accepts `personal` prop with all contact information
- Falls back to static `resumeData` if no props provided
- `showScrollButton` prop to conditionally show scroll indicator
- Maintains full accessibility and animations
- Preserves all original functionality

### 2. ResumePreview Component Enhancement

**File**: `components/admin/resume-preview.tsx`

Added Hero and Navigation to the preview:

**New Imports**:

```typescript
import { Navigation } from "../navigation";
import { HeroSection } from "../sections/hero-section";
```

**New Props**:

```typescript
interface ResumePreviewProps {
  data: ResumeData;
  showHeadings?: boolean;
  showNavigation?: boolean; // NEW
}
```

**Structure**:

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  {/* Navigation */}
  {showNavigation && <Navigation />}

  {/* Hero Section */}
  <HeroSection
    personal={{
      name: data.personal.name,
      title: data.personal.title,
      email: data.personal.email,
      phone: data.personal.phone,
      location: data.personal.location,
    }}
    showScrollButton={false}
  />

  {/* About / Summary */}
  <AboutSection ... />

  {/* Experience */}
  <ExperienceSection ... />

  {/* Skills */}
  <SkillsSection ... />

  {/* Projects */}
  <ProjectsSection ... />
</div>
```

### 3. PreviewModal Component Enhancement

**File**: `components/admin/preview-modal.tsx`

Increased modal size and improved layout for full page preview:

**Modal Dimensions**:

- Width: `w-[95vw]` with `max-w-7xl` (was `max-w-6xl`)
- Height: `h-[95vh]` (was `max-h-[90vh]`)
- Removed padding around modal for more screen space

**Header Improvements**:

- Reduced padding: `p-4` (was `p-6`)
- Smaller heading: `text-xl` (was `text-2xl`)
- Added backdrop blur to header
- Added aria-label for accessibility

**Backdrop**:

- Darker backdrop: `bg-black/70` (was `bg-black/50`)
- Better visual separation

**ResumePreview Integration**:

```tsx
<ResumePreview
  data={data}
  showHeadings={false}
  showNavigation={true} // NEW
/>
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- Preview showed only content sections (about, experience, skills, projects)
- No navigation or hero section
- Limited context of how the page would actually look
- Smaller modal size

### After

- **Complete website replica** in preview
- Navigation bar at top (matches live site)
- Hero section with name, title, and contact info
- All content sections below
- Larger modal (95% of viewport)
- Scroll indicator hidden in preview (not needed in modal)
- Perfect 1-to-1 representation of published site

## Technical Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**

   - All sections use the same components as live site
   - No duplication of code or styles
   - Changes to components automatically reflect in preview

2. **Maintainability**

   - Update component once, preview updates automatically
   - Consistent behavior between preview and live site
   - Easier to debug and test

3. **Flexibility**

   - Can toggle navigation on/off
   - Can show/hide scroll button
   - Can control section headings
   - Props allow for different use cases

4. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript support
   - Interface definitions ensure data consistency
   - Compile-time error checking

## Preview Flow

1. User uploads and parses PDF
2. AI extracts data into database structure
3. User clicks "Preview" on a version
4. PreviewModal fetches version data from API
5. ResumePreview transforms data to component props
6. Components render exactly as they would on live site
7. User sees complete website preview with:
   - Navigation
   - Hero section (name, title, contact)
   - About section (summary, education)
   - Experience section (work history)
   - Skills section (categorized skills)
   - Projects section (portfolio items)
