```

### Data Structure:

```
User "johndoe"
  ├── Version 1 (draft)

  └── Version 3 (archived)

User "janedoe"
  ├── Version 1 (published) ← Live at /janedoe
  └── Version 2 (draft)
```

### Security Layers:

```
1. Authentication (NextAuth.js) ✓
2. Session verification ✓
3. User ID from JWT token ✓
4. Database query filtering by user_id ✓
5. Foreign key constraints ✓
```
