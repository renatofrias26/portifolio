## Design Philosophy

**Minimal, Context-Aware Navigation:**

- Navigation options adapt based on current page
- User menu shows only relevant links (hides current page)
- Back button only appears on sub-pages (Profile, Job Assistant)
- View Portfolio button always accessible for quick previews

**Mobile-Friendly:**

- Logo and title on mobile
- Back button compact on small screens
- User menu fully responsive

## Tips

- **Quick Preview**: Use "View Portfolio" button to see changes without leaving admin area
- **Username in URL**: Your portfolio URL is `upfolio.com/yourusername`
- **Private Profiles**: You can always view your own portfolio, even if it's set to private
- **Version Management**: Only one version can be published at a time
- **Resume Versions**: Keep drafts private, publish when ready
