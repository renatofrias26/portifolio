## 📝 What Still Needs To Be Done

### 🔄 Phase 3: Remaining Components (IN PROGRESS)

We still need to update:

1. **Admin Components** (Medium Priority)

   - `components/admin/resume-uploader.tsx` - Instructions may reference "portfolio"
   - `components/admin/image-uploader.tsx` - Check for brand references
   - Other admin components as needed

2. **Section Components** (Low Priority - User-Facing)
   - These are mostly user-specific content, but check for any platform branding

### 🔄 Phase 4: API Routes (IN PROGRESS)

Update any error messages or system prompts:

1. **app/api/chat/route.ts**

   - ⚠️ Currently references specific user (Renato)
   - This is OK for now since it's dynamic per user
   - Consider: Generic platform branding in fallback messages

2. **app/api/auth/register/route.ts**

   - Check welcome/error messages

3. **Other API routes**
   - Response messages should reflect Upfolio branding

### 🔄 Phase 5: Documentation Files (NEEDED)

Update all documentation:

1. **docs/USER_GUIDE.md** - Rebrand to Upfolio
2. **docs/CUSTOMIZATION_COMPLETE.md** - Update platform name
3. **docs/MULTI_USER_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Update references
4. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Update
5. **IMAGE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md** - Update
6. **MULTI_USER_COMPLETE.md** - Update
7. **NEON_SETUP.md** - Check for branding

### 🎨 Phase 6: Brand Assets (CRITICAL)

**NEEDED:**

1. Create logo variations:
   - Full logo with wordmark (SVG)
   - Icon only (for favicons)
   - Light/dark mode versions
2. Update favicons:
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - apple-touch-icon.png
3. Create social sharing image:

   - OG image (1200x630px)
   - Twitter card image

4. Place in `/public` folder

### 📊 Phase 7: Database & Scripts (LOW PRIORITY)

Update console messages in:

- `scripts/setup-db.ts`
- `scripts/migrate-*.ts`

## 🎨 Brand Assets Needed

### Logo Files (HIGH PRIORITY)

Based on the Upfolio logo you showed:

```
/public/
  ├── logo.svg              # Full logo with wordmark
  ├── logo-icon.svg         # Icon only (U with arrow)
  ├── logo-light.svg        # Light mode variant
  ├── logo-dark.svg         # Dark mode variant
  ├── logo.png              # PNG fallback (for OG)
  └── og-image.png          # Social sharing (1200x630)
```

### Favicon Updates

Replace current favicons with Upfolio branding:

- Use the "U with arrow" icon
- Upfolio Blue (#5B67F7) as primary color
- Ensure visibility at small sizes
